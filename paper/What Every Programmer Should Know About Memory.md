## Presentation

### Key Topics for a 25-Minute Presentation:

#### The Problem (Section 1, Abstract): (~2 mins)
- CPUs are much faster than main memory (DRAM).
- Memory access is often the real bottleneck in modern programs.
- Hardware tries to help (caches), but programmers need to understand memory to write efficient code.

#### The Memory Hierarchy (Sections 2.1, 3.1): (~3 mins)
- **DRAM (Main Memory):** Dense, cheap, but relatively slow and needs refreshing. (Mention capacitor/refresh briefly).
- **SRAM (Caches):** Very fast, doesn't need refresh, but expensive and less dense. (Mention flip-flop/6T briefly).
- **CPU Caches (L1, L2, L3):** 
  - Small, fast SRAM buffers holding copies of frequently used main memory data.
  - Explain the levels (L1 fastest/smallest, L3 slowest/largest).
  - L1 often split (L1d for data, L1i for instructions).

#### How Caches Work & Why They Matter (Sections 3.2, 3.3): (~5 mins)
- **Cache Lines:** Data is transferred between memory and cache in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64 bytes), not single bytes/words.
- **Cache Hit vs. Miss:** 
  - Hit = data found in cache (fast).
  - Miss = data must be fetched from next level or main memory (slow!).
- **Locality is Key:**
  - **Temporal Locality:** Data/code used recently is likely to be used again soon.
  - **Spatial Locality:** Data/code near recently used items is likely to be used soon. Caches exploit this by loading entire cache lines.
- **Cost of Misses:** 
  - Briefly show the relative cost difference (e.g., L1 hit ~few cycles, L2 hit ~10-30 cycles, Main memory miss ~hundreds of cycles).
  - Mention Figure 3.4 shows this impact dramatically.

#### Multi-Core/Multi-Processor Issues (Sections 3.3.4, 5.1, 6.4.1): (~5 mins)
- **Cache Coherency:** Hardware ensures cores see a consistent view of memory (briefly mention MESI ensures this).
- **False Sharing:** 
  - Crucial point! Explain how independent variables modified by different threads can end up on the same cache line, causing expensive coherency traffic (RFOs) as the line bounces between cores, even though the threads aren't logically sharing data.
  - Show Figure 6.10's result conceptually.
- **NUMA Introduction:** 
  - Briefly explain Non-Uniform Memory Access – accessing memory attached to another processor is slower than accessing local memory.
  - Common in multi-socket systems (and increasingly relevant with complex multi-core).
  - Mention Figure 5.3 conceptually (remote access cost).

#### What Programmers Can Do (Section 6 - FOCUS HERE): (~8 mins)
- **Maximize Locality / Sequential Access:** 
  - Process arrays linearly. Accessing memory sequentially allows hardware prefetchers to work effectively.
  - Contrast linear vs. column-wise matrix access (Section 6.2.1).
- **Data Structure Layout:**
  - Group data items used together within the same cache line. Use `pahole` (Section 6.2.1) as a tool example if time permits.
  - Separate frequently used data from rarely used data (structure splitting) to avoid loading useless data into the cache (Section 6.2.1).
- **Avoid False Sharing:** 
  - Pad structures or reorder variables so that variables modified independently by different threads are on different cache lines (Section 6.4.1).
- **Alignment:** 
  - Ensure data structures (especially performance-critical ones) are aligned to cache line boundaries (Section 6.2.1).
  - Mention `posix_memalign` or `__attribute__((aligned(…)))`.
- **Prefetching (Briefly):** 
  - Mention hardware prefetching exists but has limits (page boundaries).
  - Introduce software prefetching (`_mm_prefetch` intrinsic) as an explicit hint for critical situations where access patterns are known but not simple linear scans (Section 6.3).
- **NUMA Awareness:** 
  - Use thread affinity (`sched_setaffinity`, `pthread_setaffinity_np`) to place threads near their data (or group collaborating threads near each other).
  - Use memory policies (`mbind`, `set_mempolicy`) to allocate memory locally (Section 6.5).

#### Tools Mention (Section 7): (~1 min)
- Briefly mention tools exist:
  - `oprofile` (uses hardware counters for real-world profiling).
  - `cachegrind` (simulates cache behavior, good for experimenting).

#### Conclusion: (~1 min)
- Reiterate memory access is critical.
- Understanding the hierarchy and applying these techniques can yield significant performance gains.

### What to Definitely SKIP:
- Deep electronic details (transistor workings beyond 1T/6T, detailed timings like tRAS/tRCD).
- Specific memory types (DDR generations, FB-DRAM).
- Detailed cache associativity math/diagrams (just the concept matters).
- Virtual Memory details (Section 4, TLB) – Important, but less directly actionable for application code cache performance in a short talk.
- Complex atomic operations (Section 6.4.2, 8.1) – Mention synchronization is needed, but skip the details.
- Transactional Memory / Vector Ops (Section 8) – Future tech.
- Detailed tool usage examples.

This focuses on the **why** (performance gap), the **what** (memory hierarchy, cache basics, NUMA), and the **how** (actionable programming techniques in Section 6). Good luck with your presentation!
