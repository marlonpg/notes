Overall Summary of Section 2 (Commodity Hardware Today):
This section describes the typical hardware architecture found in modern commodity computers, focusing on how CPUs connect to memory and other devices. It explains the traditional Northbridge/Southbridge architecture and its limitations, leading to the development of systems with integrated memory controllers and the rise of Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA). It introduces the fundamental differences between RAM types (SRAM vs. DRAM) and the technical details of DRAM access, highlighting the latency and bandwidth constraints that programmers need to understand.

Subsection Summaries:

Introduction (pp. 3-4):

Discusses the prevalence of commodity hardware and multi-core/multi-socket systems.
Details the traditional Northbridge/Southbridge architecture (Figure 2.1), where CPUs connect via a Front Side Bus (FSB) to the Northbridge (memory controller), which connects to RAM and the Southbridge (I/O).
Identifies bottlenecks: shared FSB, single RAM port via Northbridge.
Explains Direct Memory Access (DMA) allowing devices to bypass the CPU for RAM access, but still consuming Northbridge bandwidth.
Introduces alternative designs like external memory controllers (Figure 2.2) and integrated memory controllers (Figure 2.3), which increase bandwidth but introduce NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access), where access time depends on memory location relative to the CPU.
2.1 RAM Types (pp. 5-7):

Contrasts Static RAM (SRAM) and Dynamic RAM (DRAM).
SRAM: Uses a 6-transistor cell (Figure 2.4), is fast, retains data as long as powered (no refresh needed), but is complex and expensive. Used primarily for CPU caches.
DRAM: Uses a simple 1-transistor, 1-capacitor cell (Figure 2.5). It's dense and cheap, making it suitable for main memory. However, it's slower, the capacitor charge leaks (requiring constant refresh cycles), and reading the cell discharges the capacitor (requiring recharge).
Explains DRAM addressing uses multiplexing (sending row then column address) to reduce pin count (Figure 2.7).
2.2 DRAM Access Technical Details (pp. 8-12):

Focuses on Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) and its successors (DDR, DDR2, DDR3).
Explains the read access timing protocol: activate row (RAS), wait tRCD, select column (CAS), wait CAS Latency (CL), then transfer data (Figure 2.8).
Details the precharge command (Figure 2.9) required before activating a new row (delay tRP) and the minimum time a row must be active (tRAS), adding latency.
Describes how DDR generations increase bandwidth (transferring 2, 4, or 8 bits per clock cycle via I/O buffers) without proportionally increasing core array frequency (Figures 2.10-2.13, Tables 2.1, 2.2).
Mentions Fully Buffered DRAM (FB-DRAM) as a serial bus alternative allowing more channels and DIMMs per channel (p. 11-12).
Concludes DRAM access involves significant protocol overhead and latency, making sequential access much more efficient than random access.
2.3 Other Main Memory Users (pp. 12-13):

Points out that high-performance devices (network cards, storage controllers) use DMA to access main memory directly, competing with the CPU(s) for memory bandwidth (Figure 2.1).
Notes that systems using main memory as Video RAM for integrated graphics suffer significant performance and latency impacts due to frequent graphics access.
